# simd-ddm

This software was originally developed to study the dynamics of confined liquid crystals, but extends naturally to a variety of systems.
The main point of this solution is to compute efficiently DDM. We implemented a CPU version of [G. Cerchiari *et al* (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=_PESpHQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_PESpHQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C)'s paper.
